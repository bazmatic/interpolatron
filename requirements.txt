# No additional Python packages required for basic functionality

# Optional: For enhanced video processing capabilities
# opencv-python>=4.5.0  # Uncomment if you want to add OpenCV features
# numpy>=1.20.0         # Uncomment if you want to add numerical processing

# TLBVFI AI Interpolation Dependencies (Optional)
# Install these for AI-powered video interpolation
# torch>=1.9.0
# torchvision>=0.10.0
# opencv-python>=4.5.0
# Pillow>=8.0.0
# numpy>=1.20.0
# einops>=0.4.0
# omegaconf>=2.1.0
# tqdm>=4.60.0

# CuPy is now optional - install for CUDA acceleration, skip for CPU-only operation
# cupy-cuda11x>=13.0.0  # Uncomment this line if you have CUDA and want GPU acceleration
